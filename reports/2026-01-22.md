  - Authors: n/a
  - Affiliations: not provided
  - FP8 GEMM library tuned for NVIDIA Hopper Tensor Cores, targeting high-throughput matrix multiplication by leveraging Hopper-specific capabilities (e.g., Tensor Core FP8 paths).
  - Uses JIT compilation to specialize kernels to problem shapes/layouts at runtime, reducing overhead and improving GEMM efficiency for real workloads.
  - Exploits Hopper TMA (Tensor Memory Accelerator) features to optimize data movement (async bulk transfers/pipelining), improving GEMM utilization and end-to-end performance.
