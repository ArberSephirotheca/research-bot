# rag/

RAG artifacts generated from paper PDFs and report Markdown.

## Files

- `chunks.jsonl`: text chunks with `text`, `source`, `chunk_index`
- `embeddings.jsonl`: same as chunks plus `embedding` vector

The `source` field points at either `papers/...pdf` or `reports/...md`.
`paper_summaries/` stores cached summaries generated by `/ask_paper` (expires after `RAG_PAPER_SUMMARY_CACHE_TTL_SECS`).

These files are generated by `scripts/rag_ingest.py` and are ignored by git.
